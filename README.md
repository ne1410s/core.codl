Indulge your apps with codl: a component model library

-- todo:

- Type checking - i.e. min/max (is even a valid date?)

- Dedicated decs, for string, number, boolean, enum, Date, &c;
- Each of these has TypedPropDec constraints for allowable type conversions. Important not to go overboard here i think

- Enum type / options validation
